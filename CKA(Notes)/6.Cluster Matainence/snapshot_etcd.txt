The master node in our cluster is planned for a regular maintenance reboot tonight. While we do not anticipate anything to go wrong, we are required to take the necessary backups. Take a snapshot of the ETCD database using the built-in snapshot functionality.

Store the backup file at location /opt/snapshot-pre-boot.db
